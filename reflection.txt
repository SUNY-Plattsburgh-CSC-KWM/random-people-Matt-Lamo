As a whole, this assignment wasn't actually that challenging compared to the shape editor. My main challenges that I came across was trying to implement the changing color when hovered over, and the tooltip hover effect for the phone number. I spent too much time overthinking applying tooltip style effects using CSS for the phone number to appear than to just add a title that did the same effect. Additionally, I originally planned to use the ID of each row to add a listener after the table was built, which was overcomplicated and didn't work compared to just adding the listeners during the loop creating the table.
